**Belly Button Biodiversity - Creating Interactive Dashboards using the Plotly.JS Graphing Library**

Exploring the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), creating an interactive dashboard utilizing the Plotly JS libary, and deploying the full stack application to Heroku.


**Step 1 - Plotly.js**

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.

Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

  - Use `sample_values` as the values for the PIE chart.

  - Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the pie chart.

  - Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.


Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

  - Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  - Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  - Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  - Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  - Use `otu_labels` for the text values.


Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

**Deploy your Flask app to Heroku.**

Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the `/metadata/<sample>`route.

- You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 - 9.

- Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

**Flask API**

Use Flask API to serve the data needed for your plots.
